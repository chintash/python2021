Types of Memory - Python


There are two types of Memory :

1) Stack Memory 
2) Heap Memory


Stack Memory:

Stack memory is arrnaged in mutliple blocks and is serialized or Arranged. 
Stack basically stores the Keys/Variables only

whereas in Heap is Dynamic Memory, there is no arrangment on how the data is store, it is allocated dynamically.
Heap memory bascically stores the Values only 

Mapping between the Stack Memory and Heap memory is done via Hashing*
